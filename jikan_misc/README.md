### Feature 1: Rankings of Most-Watched Genres (Top 5)
The `getMostWatchedGenres()` method analyzes the user's anime list and returns the top 5 most-watched genres with their counts.

### Feature 2: Shows with Rating of 10
The `getPerfectlyRatedShows()` method filters the user's list to return all anime that the user has rated as 10/10.

### Feature 3: Top Shows from Top Genres
The `getTopShowsByGenres()` method:
- Identifies the user's top 10 most-watched genres
- For each genre, fetches the top 5 highest-rated shows from the Jikan API
- Creates a dropdown interface where users can select any of these genres to see the top shows

### Additional Feature: Personalized Recommendations
I've added a `getPersonalizedRecommendations()` method that:
- Analyzes the user's top 3 favorite genres
- Finds highly-rated anime in those genres that the user hasn't watched yet
- Returns a curated list of recommendations based on the user's taste

### Usage
The code includes:
- A core `MALAnalyzer` class with all the analytical functionality
- An `analyzeMALProfile` function that runs all analyses for a given username
- A `createUI` function that builds a simple browser interface with all the requested features

You can use this by:
1. Including the code in an HTML page
2. Calling `createUI()` to build the interface
3. Entering a MAL username and clicking "Analyze Profile"

The interface will display all the requested features, including the genre dropdown selector that shows top anime for each genre.
