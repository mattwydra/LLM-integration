# Anime Recommendation Service

## Features
- Fetches anime recommendations based on user input.
- Uses the jikan API to retrieve anime details.
- Displays anime title and description as well as plans to include the title image.
- Works entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend required).
- Doesn't require an API key, so uptime is constant even though website is static.

## How It Works
1. User inputs the name of an anime.
2. The script queries the jikan API for related anime.
3. The results are displayed with titles and descriptions.

## How to Use
#### Local:
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
- Enter an anime name in the input field and click the search button.
- Browse through the recommendations.
