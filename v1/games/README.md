# Game Recommendation Service

## Features
- Fetches game recommendations based on user input.
- Uses the igdb API for game searches.
- Displays game titles, descriptions, and (eventually) cover images.
- Requires a backend for API calls.

## How It Works
1. User enters a game title.
2. The script searches for the game on igdb.
3. If found, the gameâ€™s Steam ID is used to fetch related recommendations.
4. The results are displayed with game titles and rating score.

## How to Use
- Clone the repo
- Run `backend.py`
- Open the `index.html` file.
- Type a game name and click the search button.
- View recommendations.
